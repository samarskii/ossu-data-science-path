# ossu-data-science-path

Here I am going to write about my journey on [Data Science Path by OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/data-science)

## My progress

<b>Total Courses Finished 2/29

Total time spent: ~13.5 hours</b>

How do I track my progress? I have a dairy, habbits tracker and I always on the clock with my Pomodoro sessions.

I am using spread-sheet template from the [Duration](https://github.com/ossu/data-science#duration) section that is publically available [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16nekQFG8Ld166QSFZxFLCH0RsiL40cGvtW6QwWWOB6Q/edit?usp=sharing) where you can see when I started, how many time I spend by my personal counting and date I finished. 

Also there will be my small personal Diary and my Certificates/Proofs of finishing.

## My Rewiews for Courses

1. [What is Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-datascience)

Well the first thing is that I completed it much faster than the promised time. If you count the time of all the free materials on Coursera, all four weeks, it will be 575 minutes of time and plus 112 minutes of Graded Assignment, and I managed in ~360 minutes passing all the materials and tests.

In general I liked the course very much, as something introductory where you can start and where a little more "general material" than practice was useful to get, so that then facing these things in the future would not be so difficult, because they have already seen them somewhere.

I especially liked the last 4 weeks, where they talked more about technical things related more to Data Engineering than to Data Science. What is Data Lake, Data Mart and Data Pipline. In general, very interesting material.

In general, all presentations and videos were very good, I liked the interviews with different guys, as well as chapters from books where they talked about how to solve problems differently and where Data Science is applied.


23. [Tool for data science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science))

The advertised course duration is 1080 minutes, but if you subtract all the paid quizzes, it amounts to 982 minutes of estimated time. I managed to complete it in 448 minutes, which is more than half the time faster than advertised.

Here are my thoughts on the course:

In the first two weeks, there seemed to be a lot of what appeared to be superficial information that could be found on the internet within 5 minutes, such as the types of tools available in DS, the languages they are written in, and so on. The first week felt almost like an advertising course for the IBM Whatson Studio product. Nevertheless, I still took away some useful things for myself, such as learning more about the use of other languages and discovering Anaconda Navigator, which I began to use more actively towards the end of the course, including in my daily practice.

The materials for weeks 3-4-5, in my opinion, were much more practical, as there were many practical tasks related to Jupyter, RStudio, Git, where one could practice and learn more about different environments. To be honest, I didn't quite understand the lab assignments from week 5 dedicated to RStudio and the R language. It all felt very basic, like "write this command to install a certain package," "write this command and get graphs on your screen," "look at these graphs like this." I didn't even understand the most basic things, except how to assign values using <-. At some point, I copied some code with a function they used in an example, I don't remember what it was, but the function returned something like result <- a * b + c. I copied it, tried to run it, but for some reason, it didn't work. I understand that it's not easy to get to grips with a language and that the course is meant for an introduction, not in-depth study, but still, it lacked directions on where and how to continue learning R.

At this point, I don't know what I will do with all this and don't understand why it couldn't be used in the same Jupyter notebooks. I mean, I understand, because that IDE is built in such a way that you can see all the data, the values you're working with, graphs all in one window, and so on. I don't know if I will continue to use this program, but I've realized that it's more convenient and easier for me to run local notebooks through Anaconda-navigator than to use Google Collab, at least until I start working with and processing larger data volumes.

I finished week 6, in the end, completing all the lab assignments there, primarily working with GitHub for the first time, feeling a bit nervous and lost with the commands, but it was a very successful first experience, although somewhat cramped. It lacks some more extensive practice. I've already learned how to create repositories, make pull requests, and will understand how all this is done and practice at least for my pet projects. In general, I've started working in JupyterLab through AnacondaNavigator installed on my computer more often. Which, in my opinion, is much more convenient and faster.

I also completed the seventh week, but I can say that it was purely dedicated to working with IBM's Cloud solutions. I didn't particularly like it, I don't know if I will use all this in my work, I haven't heard anyone in Europe talking about using this tool.

Overall, the course was interesting, and I don't regret the time spent, invaluable practice, and the motivation to use all this more often in my life, namely GitHub, Anaconda-navigator.
